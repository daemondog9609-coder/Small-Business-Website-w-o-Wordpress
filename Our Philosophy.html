        <article class="about-fera">
          <p>FERA was born from a simple belief: what you put on your body matters as much as what you put into it.</p>

          <p>In a world flooded with synthetic shortcuts, artificial fragrances, and mass-produced convenience, we chose a harder path—one rooted in nature, tradition, and respect for the land. Fera means wild, and we embrace that wildness not as chaos, but as balance—raw, honest, and intentional.</p>

          <p>We believe nature already perfected what modern industry tries to imitate. Plants, oils, clays, and botanicals have served humanity for thousands of years, and we see no reason to reinvent what already works. Our products are crafted with carefully selected ingredients that are minimally processed, thoughtfully sourced, and chosen for purpose—not filler.</p>

          <p>At the core of FERA is a commitment to organic sourcing and local stewardship. Whenever possible, we partner with local farms, growers, and horticulturists who share our values—people who work with the land, not against it. By sourcing organically and locally, we support small businesses, strengthen regional agriculture, and ensure greater transparency from soil to skin.</p>

          <p>FERA stands for regenerative thinking—supporting practices that restore rather than deplete. That means favoring sustainable sourcing, reducing unnecessary waste, and creating products that honor both the skin and the environment they come from. We don’t chase trends. We build things meant to last.</p>

          <p>We also believe in simplicity with integrity. No inflated claims. No gimmicks. No ingredients you can’t pronounce or don’t need. Every formula is designed to be effective, honest, and respectful of the body’s natural balance.</p>

          <p>Above all, FERA exists for people who value craftsmanship, self-reliance, and a deeper connection to the natural world. Those who understand that real quality is felt—not advertised.</p>

          <p>This isn’t about perfection.<br>
          It’s about intention.<br>
          It’s about returning to what’s real.</p>

          <p><strong>This is FERA. By nature's design.</strong></p>
